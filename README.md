### Advantages
- Separate Scene settings for each platform
- Build pressets (includes dynamic build path, automating post-build commands, opening multiple instances etc.)
- Simple & Open. You can edit the code and add new configs to pressets etc. to meet your needs.
- Automation. If you're using git in your project, you can take advantage of build automation. it pulls the branch from remote and performs a new build.
- Detailed build report right in the editor. You can view full build report in the logs, so you won't have to install 3rd parties or open logs file manually to view the build reports.

### Disadvantages
- Only tested on Windows
- Can only build for a limited number of platforms
- Not many error reporting around. (This project is not for beginners. If you use it, you're expected to know how git and building works)
- Bugs might lerk around unnoticed. It's a personal project, so it's not been fully tested on different machines and with different scenarios. If you feel adventurous and want to try hacks, expect bugs.
